# pyEBC
A Python libray to control ZTE Tech EBC series
battery testers. As I only own the EBC-A20, it may or may not work on other devices of the series.

Minimum requirement is Python 3.6

Thanks to Sven for [revealing the protocol basics](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/519483) to me and (JOGAsoft)[https://github.com/JOGAsoft/EBC-controller] for the missing details.
